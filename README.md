# Zero-Knowledge

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) represent the most advanced cryptography mechanisms used to achieve security, privacy, and scalability in blockchains. Zero-Knowledge works by enabling one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they know some secret information without revealing the information. This allows data to be verified without revealing the data directly. The prover generates a proof regarding the validity of the data, and posts the proof on chain to be verified by miners.
